# Welcome!

First off, thank you for purchasing this plugin, if you didn't then please consider doing so if this plugin benefits your server significantly.

This plugin allows your players to give items to the "Hoarder" during Hoarder events.

You can specify which items you want the Hoarder to pick from and if you want the Hoarder to give money to the player in exchange for the item.

The top players at the end of each Hoarder event will be rewarded with treasures (items)!
