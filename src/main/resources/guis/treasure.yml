# Treasure gui-type ALWAYS includes the dynamic item 'treasure' which is used to display the treasure items
# The dynamic item will fill any empty slots in the gui

# Treasure gui-type is a paginated gui and thus has extra actions and item attributes
# TODO: hide-if-page-not-available: If true, the item will not be shown if the next/previous page does not exist
# [BACK_PAGE]: Goes to the previous page, if available
# [NEXT_PAGE]: Goes to the next page, if available
