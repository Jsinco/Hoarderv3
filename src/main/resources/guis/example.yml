# Example GUI. With Hoarder, you can make your own custom guis and have them be viewed by running [OPEN] guis/<your_gui>.yml
# This gui has a type of 'OTHER' which means no dynamic items will be added to it, and it is just a standalone GUI
# If you choose to make multiple types of other guis such as TREASURE or STATS, they will have their dynamic items added to them, attributes, etc.

# As listed in info.md, here are all the gui types:
# MAIN - The main gui of Hoarder that shows the active material and remaining time
# TREASURE - The gui that shows the treasure items
# STATS - The gui that shows the stats of the players currently in the Hoarder event
# CLAIM_TREASURE - The gui that shows claimable treasure items the player can click to claim
# OTHER - Any other gui that you can open with [OPEN] guis/<your_gui>.yml
