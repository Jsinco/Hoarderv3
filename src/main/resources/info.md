# Welcome!

First off, thank you for purchasing this plugin, if you didn't then please consider doing so if this plugin benefits your server significantly.

This plugin allows your players to give items to the "Hoarder" during Hoarder events.

You can specify which items you want the Hoarder to pick from and if you want the Hoarder to give money to the player in exchange for the item.

The top players at the end of each Hoarder event will be rewarded with treasures (items)!

# GUIS

The goal of this plugin was to allow players to compete in hoarding competitions and earn prizes all within
the Hoarder plugin itself.

This is my 3rd re-iteration of the "Hoarder" plugin and the most customizable one yet.


There are 5 types of GUIs
MAIN, TREASURE, STATS, TREASURE_CLAIM, OTHER

Each GUI has an associated pool of dynamic items with it.

You can create your own GUIs by adding files to the /guis/ folder.

# Dynamic Items

Dynamic items are special items that go into their respective GUI type.
Example: The TREASURE gui type has the dynamic item called "treasure" which represents all the treasure items Hoarder has.

Not every part of a dynamic item is customizable. Dynamic items that are customizable can be modified in the
dynamicitems.yml file.
